[Arbitration](https://cutt.ly/fJLr3q8) is the practice of buying and selling securities, commodities, or other property on more than one exchange to take advantage of price discrepancies.

[Cryptocurrencies](https://cutt.ly/yJLtXHH) are a perfect example of an asset class where arbitrage opportunities can exist between exchanges.

For example, on one exchange the price of Bitcoin may be $10,000, while on another exchange the price of Bitcoin may be $11,000.

If you buy [Bitcoin](https://cutt.ly/yJLtXHH) on the first exchange and sell it on the second exchange, you will have made a $1,000 profit.

Arbitrage between exchanges can be a very profitable way to make money, but it can also be quite risky.

There are a few things you need to keep in mind if you want to try arbitrating between cryptocurrency exchanges:

1. Make sure you are aware of the fees associated with each exchange.

2. Make sure you are aware of the liquidity of each exchange.

Some exchanges are more liquid than others. This means that if you need to sell your coins, you will be able to do so more quickly and at a better price on some exchanges than others. It is therefore important to be aware of the liquidity of each exchange before you buy coins on it.

CoinMarketCap.com is a good resource for checking the liquidity of different exchanges.
