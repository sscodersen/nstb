Memorial Day is an American holiday, observed on the last Monday of May, that commemorates the men and women who died while serving in the United States military. Originally known as Decoration Day, it was first observed in 1868 to honor Union soldiers who died in the Civil War. By the early 20th century, Memorial Day had been extended to honor all Americans who died while in the military service.

Today, Memorial Day is celebrated by parades, picnics, and barbecues. It is also a time for reflection, as Americans remember the sacrifices made by those who died in defense of their country.

The history of Memorial Day is closely linked with the history of the American Civil War. In 1868, General John A. Logan, the head of the Union veterans organization, the Grand Army of the Republic, issued a decree that May 30th should be observed as Memorial Day.
