[Deal spotlight:](https://amzn.to/3P5z0N6)

[TCL 5-Series 75-Inch Google TV Model S546](https://amzn.to/3P5z0N6)
Deal price: $800; street price: $900

The 75-inch version of our top budget Google-enabled 4K TV pick is back down to the previous low. The TCL 5-Series model S546 provides good picture quality and great integrated streaming options, offering a full array of local-dimming backlights and the Google smart-TV interface. While its overall brightness, contrast, and motion quality don't measure up to the best LCD and OLED screens, we still think the TCL 5-Series provides a great viewing experience.


[Deal spotlight:](https://amzn.to/3P1hh9t)

[iRobot Roomba 692 Robot Vacuum](https://amzn.to/3P1hh9t)
Deal price: $180; street price: $280

The iRobot Roomba 600 series is a long standing favorite amongst our reviewers. The Roomba 692 is no exception. It's Wi-Fi enabled and works with both Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. The 600 series comes in a few variants, but if it’s a Roomba model that starts with a 6, they're mostly the same, save varying Wi-Fi capabilities and some aesthetic differences. Down to $180, this deal is only a few dollars more than the lowest we've seen it for, and the matching the best price we've seen this year.


[Deal spotlight:](https://amzn.to/3yYvsXm)

[KEF Mu3 Wireless Earbuds Silver grey](https://amzn.to/3yYvsXm)
Deal price: $130; street price: $230

The KEF Mu3 is one of the best-sounding pairs of true wireless earbuds we’ve ever tested. While they're not an official pick, these earbuds have great sound quality with clear highs, deep (but not overpowering) bass notes, and a surprisingly large soundstage for tiny earbuds. The active noise cancellation is middling and there's no track-reverse option with the controls, but if those aren't deal breakers, these headphones are sure to please.


[Ring doorbell, Echo Show, Audible, and more](https://amzn.to/3PmhC67)
If you're looking for deals on Amazon devices, you've come to the right place. We'll keep this section updated, as well as our roundup of the best Amazon Device Deals. If you're looking for a Ring Video Doorbell Wired, which is our budget pick for best smart doorbell camera, we expect it to be discounted to under $50 during Prime Day.
Matching the best price we saw during Black Friday, this is a solid Prime exclusive deal for a 4th Gen Amazon Echo smart speaker that comes with a Sengled Bluetooth color smart light bulb. With Alexa, the Echo can play music, answer questions, control your smart-home devices, and buy stuff from Amazon—all with a few words. The Echo is our pick for the best Alexa smart speaker, and although the Sengled bulb isn't an official pick, we've recommended some of their bulbs in the past. (Plus, it's free!)


[Amazon Echo Show 5 Smart Display 2nd Gen, 2021 Release](https://amzn.to/3PmhC67)
Deal price: $35; street price: $70

Part smart speaker and part tablet, the compact Amazon Echo Show 5 is a good display for a nightstand or bathroom counter. Our smaller-screen pick does everything the larger Show 8 can do, including play music, check the weather report, and trigger any smart-home routines. It also has an auto-dimming screen when you turn out the lights, so it shouldn't keep you up at night.


[Amazon Echo Dot 4th Gen Smart Speaker + Sengled Bluetooth Color Smart Bulb](https://amzn.to/3PmhC67)
Deal price: $20; street price: $40

As the smaller version of our top Alexa smart speaker, the Echo Dot is a great option for people who want to snag a smaller smart speaker on the cheap. Our budget pick features an audio-out port and Bluetooth connectivity, so you can connect the Dot to a Bluetooth speaker or to a larger audio system if you want better sound. This is a new low price for the Echo Dot on its own, and an even better value if you add in the free Sengled Bluetooth bulb. While we haven't tested that Sengled bulb in particular, it's a simpler version of our former budget pick and it's free (usually $15).


[Amazon Music Unlimited four months free](https://amzn.to/3PmhC67)
Deal price: $0; street price: $32

Prime members who have yet to try Amazon Music Unlimited can get four months free. Like its competitor Apple Music, Amazon Music now offers HD spatial audio—an improvement in the quality of sound that makes your listening experience a lot more pleasant. Other great features that come with an Amazon Music subscription include ad-free access to any song, unlimited skips, and hands-free listening with Alexa for those who are already part of the Amazon smart-home ecosystem. This deal regularly crops up around this time of year, but free is hard to beat, so it’s still a nice chance to experiment with a new music streaming service. Be aware that after the free four-month subscription expires, you will be automatically charged $8.99 per month.


[Audible Premium Subscription 3-Month](https://amzn.to/3PmhC67)
Deal price: $0; street price: $45

If you have a book lover in your life, or are one yourself, this is a great chance to try out an Audible Premium Plus subscription. Normally $15/month, Amazon Prime members can get the first three months of this subscription for free. On top of accessing tons of audiobooks, podcasts, and original content, you'll receive one credit to purchase any premium selection title each month. After the trial period is over, you'll automatically be billed for the regular monthly membership fee—so be sure to cancel if you aren't interested in continuing with the service.


[Amazon Echo Glow Night-Light](https://amzn.to/3PmhC67)
Deal price: $17; street price: $28

Help your child sleep through the night with one of our smart night light picks, the Echo Glow. It doesn't have any physical controls, but adjusting the brightness and 16 different color options is as easy as tapping the light or using the accompanying app or your Alexa device. We've seen better discounts for this smart lighting device, but it's still a  great way to regulate your little one's bedtime routine—an essential step for children to sleep better over time—while adding some personality to their bedroom.


[Echo Dot Kids Edition Smart Speaker 4th Generation](https://amzn.to/3PmhC67)
Deal price: $25; street price: $50

As the kids' version of our budget Alexa speaker pick, the Echo Dot Kids Edition offers all the standard Echo Dot features for about half the price—such as asking Alexa to play music, reading stories, and calling friends and family. Plus, it sounds good enough to use as a nightstand speaker or even as a small kitchen speaker. Down to a new low of $25 for Prime members, the Kids Edition comes with a solid two-year replacement warranty and is available in your choice of two cute, child-friendly designs (with a tiger or panda printed on the fabric).


[Echo Show 8 Smart Display 2nd Gen, 2021 release, Refurbished with delayed shipping](https://amzn.to/3PmhC67)
Deal price: $70; street price: $115

The Amazon Echo Show 8 (2nd Generation) is simple to use thanks to its excellent on-screen menus and Alexa's always-impressive conversational chops. Its speaker also produces clear audio and is powerful enough to fill a room. Down to the lowest price we've seen for a refurbished model, this is a solid chance to pick up the latest Show 8 for less. Available in both black and white.


[Echo Dot Kids Edition + Echo Glow Bundle](https://amzn.to/3PmhC67)
Deal price: $36; street price: $65

If you're having a hard time getting your little one into a regular bedtime routine, Amazon's Echo Dot Kids and Echo Glow bundle, which features one of our smart nightlight picks, is back on sale. The Glow has a range of 16 colors and can cue a bedtime countdown controlled by another Amazon Echo device—in this case, the included Dot Kids, a kid-friendly version of the vaunted pint-sized smart speaker, available in tiger or panda print.


[Kindle Paperwhite deals](https://amzn.to/3RrUyVo)
In recent weeks, we've seen some deals on refurbished Kindle Paperwhites, but they've been primarily for the 2018 model. At this point, we'd recommend forgoing the older models and waiting for Prime Day sales on the newest Paperwhites, which support USB-C charging.

Wirecutter recommends the 2021 Paperwhite Kids edition over the standard 2021 Paperwhite. Our reasoning is value, as the Kids edition includes a case, a two-year warranty (versus the standard’s one-year), and no ads, for only $20 more. Based on Black Friday prices and sales we've seen earlier in 2022, we anticipate prices at or just over $100 for the Kids edition during Prime Day, with prices of the standard Paperwhite coming in at around $90.


[Laptop, Chromebook, and accessory deals](https://amzn.to/3nVDsli)

In our new age of Zoom meetings and video conferencing, sometimes the subpar webcam on your laptop just won't cut it. Our budget pick for the best webcam, the Logitech C615, is perfect if you're seeking a sub-$50 option. While the overall video quality isn't as good as our top pick, it still offers 1080p resolution and looks better than any other camera we tested around the same price. Matching the best price we've seen this year, this deal will help ensure you aren't a pixelated blur when video-chatting with others.


[Headphone deals](https://amzn.to/3yziwFI)

Drown out the din with our top noise-cancelling headphones pick, the Bose Noise Cancelling Headphones 700, now down to $223 with code SUMMER20SAVE. This pair is manufacturer-refurbished from the Bose eBay storefront and comes with a comprehensive two-year warranty. Though we've seen slightly better deals on refurbished options, this is still an excellent opportunity to save if you're looking for a pair of comfortable and lightweight headphones that offer superior adjustable noise cancellation.


[Kitchen deals](https://amzn.to/3c0YJYe)


Our bigger batches stand mixer pick, the Pro 600 Series has a bigger bowl, stronger motor, and added heft, but also takes up more space and runs much louder than our top pick. It’s a workhorse stand mixer that’s so dependable it’s often found in professional kitchens. This refurbished model comes direct from the manufacturer and includes a 1-year warranty. Although this refurb deal isn't the lowest price we've seen, notable price drops for the KitchenAid Pro 600 series (new or refurbished) have been few and far between in recent years.


[Baby and kid product deals](https://amzn.to/3RiLDWm)


The runner-up Britax B-Lively stroller is comparable to our top pick in design, handling, and maneuverability, plus has a similarly easy-to-use recline. It also has a larger, more accessible storage basket and a brake mechanism that requires less effort to engage. However, the B-Lively is only compatible with Britax and BOB car seats. It won't work with the popular Chicco Keyfit 30, our infant car seat pick, or other brands, so it's not a good choice if you already own one of those car seats. Nevertheless, this $143 deal marks a new low for this stroller.


[Health and fitness deals](https://amzn.to/3nUnJ6k)

Suppose you've been interested in trying a massage gun without investing hundreds of dollars on a higher-end model. In that case, this is a great chance to save on the already affordable HoMedics Therapist Select Percussion Massager. This HoMedics model delivers a less-intense deep-tissue massage than some of our other picks, but it's light, comfortable in hand, and cheaper than most options. Overall, it's less powerful and more vibratory than other alternatives, but it still offers three speeds at 3,000 ppm.


[Upright, robot and cordless vacuum deals](https://amzn.to/3c7YJ8E)
Prime Day is always a prime time to snag one of our vacuum picks at a low price. So far this year, several of the robot vacs we recommend have popped up as early Prime Day deals; we expect to see more of those deals, as well as some nice discounts on canister vacs and upright vacs from Shark, as Prime Day progresses. As for cordless stick vacuums, we may see a sale or two on those, but we’re not expecting such deals to be as plentiful—however, if and when we do see those deals surface, we’ll post them here.


[Home deals](https://amzn.to/3uEoO5K)

The Coway AP-1512HH Mighty air purifier is effective, efficient, and affordable. Not only does our top pick work great, but during our long-term testing, we've found it to be quite reliable. Don't let its size fool you. Even though it weighs under 13 pounds and measures at 16.8 x 9.6 x 18.3 inches, within 30 minutes it reduced heavy smoke pollution in a 135-square-foot office by 99.6%. If clean air is valuable to you, this deal price of $146 is a rare opportunity to purchase a high-quality air purifier and save a few bucks too.


[Bluetooth headset deals](https://amzn.to/3c0ZjVU)
Our pick for bluetooth headset with the best background noise reduction, the Plantronics Voyager 5200.

If you make a lot of phone calls on the go and want a more advanced microphone than your average pair of Bluetooth headphones, consider a Bluetooth headset instead. Modern headsets aren't just a lingering vestige of the early 2000s—they make you sound more clear even in the busiest environments. Our pick for optimal noise-cancellation offers incredible voice isolation. Just keep in mind that you'll lose some of your voice's natural warmth and smoothness when using the Poly Voyager 5200. The 5200 sees a lot of price fluctuations but this drop to $70 is a new low.


[TV deals](https://amzn.to/3IvVAM9)
A collection of Prime Day preview sales on Fire TVs started June 21. We've never recommended Fire TVs, as we don't think they offer good value at their usual MSRPs, but our experts think they're somewhat more worthy of consideration when they're heavily discounted, especially if you're invested in the Alexa ecosystem. Of the ones available for sale, senior staff writer Lee Neikirk prefers the Amazon Omni Series 4K, noting, “that price for the 55-inch is solid.” Lee warns that we may see competitive pricing on better TVs during Prime Day itself.

We're also noting a number of sales on 2021 model year TVs, with deals on LG's C1 OLED line leading the way. If you've considered the tradeoffs and want to pick up one of these older models, you can find discounted TVs and home theater gear on our dedicated TV Deals page. We're presently testing the 2022 iteration of this TV—you can find our early impressions in our OLED TV guide.

We've found the first few Prime Day TV and TV accessory deals worthy of notice


[Apple deals, including Apple Watch Series 7](https://amzn.to/3c4RBu2)
The Apple Watch Series 7, with a dark gray braided wrist band.
We expect a slate of Apple deals during Prime Day, but only select Apple products will see significant discounts. We're anticipating notable price drops on the Apple Watch Series 7 and SE, along with various iPad models, specifically the iPad Mini 6th Gen, the iPad Air 5th Gen, the Mac mini, and perhaps some models of the iPad Pro.
The M1 Macbook Air is also likely to see some small discounts. The M2 Air will be released within the next few weeks, but has a substantially higher starting price at $200 more than the M1. So, should you buy the M1 if it's on sale? Our experts will be testing the M2 model soon. In the meantime, the M1 remains a solid option for everyday tasks, especially if it's substantially discounted, but those seeking the latest and greatest should probably wait. We'll work in consultation with our writers during Prime Day to assess the M1 sales and see if any are still worth it.



[Google smart display deals](https://amzn.to/3RrNAQk)
If you're looking to try out a new smart display, we think home chefs already invested in the Google Assistant ecosystem will get the most out of the Nest Hub Max. With its large 10-inch screen, the Nest can easily transform from a beautiful digital photo frame to your own personal cookbook—verbally walking you through recipes so you don't have to touch anything with ingredient-dirtied hands. Matching the lowest we've seen, this is a great chance to pick up this versatile Google smart display.


[Lego deals](https://amzn.to/3IrIQX0)
Lego bricks aren't just for children, and we've already seen some early Prime Day deals come and go on some of our staff's favorite sets. While we don't have any Lego deals right now, we're keeping an eye out for discounts on any of our favorite Lego sets for adults.

[Style deals](https://amzn.to/3Pi81xf)
Our favorite round sunglasses are stylish, comfortable, sturdy, and include a lifetime warranty—a great perk for sunglasses under $20. Although this listing includes both polarized and non-polarized options, a polarized pair is the better buy for improved glare protection.

[Gaming deals](https://amzn.to/3ayec1p)
Game console deals dried up almost entirely during the pandemic, as consoles were hard to come by even at full price. So far in 2022, we've noted some deals on select consoles that we're hopeful will see markdowns during Prime Day. We've tracked sales on the Xbox Series S, the Nintendo Switch Lite, and even the non-OLED Switch in recent months. We're hopeful that we'll see these consoles, along with accessories like the Switch Pro controller, well-discounted during Prime Day.
