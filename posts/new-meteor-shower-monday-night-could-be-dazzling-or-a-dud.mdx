A celestial event of great import will take place in 2022, when the shower of tau Herculids reaches its peak. This shower, which is produced by the comet tau Herculid, occurs every 33 years and is expected to be especially impressive in 2022. The tau Herculids are a meteor shower that occurs each year in late July and early August. The shower is named for the comet tau Herculid, which is the source of the meteors. The comet was discovered in 1857, and the meteor shower was first observed in 1922. The comet is not particularly bright, but it does produce a large number of meteors. The tau Herculids are considered a minor shower, but they can sometimes produce a spectacular display. The shower is expected to peak in 2022, when it will produce up to 30 meteors per hour. The best time to observe the shower is after midnight, when the sky is darkest.

On the night of October 6th, 2017, amateur astronomers in the Southern Hemisphere noticed a flurry of meteors. Some speculated that these meteors could be early sightings of the tau Herculid meteor shower, which is expected to peak on the night of December 12th.

If these meteors are indeed from the tau Herculid shower, it would be the first time that the shower has been observed before its peak. The tau Herculid shower is notoriously difficult to observe, because it coincides with the Christmas holiday season, when many people are busy with festivities.

The tau Herculid shower is produced by the comet 3200 Phaethon, which is thought to be the remnants of a comet that broke apart about 5,000 years ago. The meteors in the tau Herculid shower are thought to be debris from this comet.

The tau Herculid shower is expected to produce about 10 meteors per hour at its peak. The shower is named for the constellation Hercules, where it appears to radiate from. The shower is expected to peak on the night of July 17th and the morning of July 18th.

The tau Herculid shower is produced by the Earth passing through a stream of debris left behind by the comet P/200 Skiff. The comet was discovered by Edwin Eugene Hubble in September of Skiff. The comet is very small, with a nucleus only about 1 kilometer in diameter. The comet last passed by Earth in 2003, and is not expected to return until 2040.

The tau Herculid shower is not as well known as some of the other showers, such as the Perseids or the Geminids. However, the shower produces a good number of meteors, and is worth checking out if you are in the right part of the world. The best time to view the shower is after midnight, when the constellation Hercules is visible in the night sky, it is said to be in the "hour of the lion."

This phrase is derived from the ancient Greek myth of Hercules, who killed the Nemean lion as one of his twelve labors.

The constellation Hercules is located in the northern sky, and can be seen at latitudes between +85° and −75°. It is best viewed in the summer months, when it is visible in the evening sky.

Hercules is one of the largest and most easily recognizable constellations in the night sky. It is made up of a prominent grouping of stars known as the Keystone, as well as a number of smaller constellations.

The constellation Hercules is named for the Greek hero of myth, who was famed for his strength and bravery. According to legend, Hercules was born to the god Zeus and the mortal woman Alcmene.
